### Hi, I'm Dillon 👋

👨‍🎨 I craft quality React frontends and have a passion for all things Javascript. 

<br />

🌱 I stay inspired by always learning something new. I’m currently learning more about the back-end, specifically GraphQL, express and Apollo. 

<br />

Currently collaborating with clients and co-workers to build solid products at <a href="https://formidable.com/">Formidable</a>. 

<br />

Fun fact: I have 2 Golden-Doodles named Bowie⚡️ and Phoebe. My hobbies include Golfing, reading, writing, and playing guitar 🎸
