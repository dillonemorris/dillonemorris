### Hi, I'm Dillon 👋

👨‍🎨 I craft quality React frontends and have a passion for all things Javascript. 

<br />

🌱 I stay inspired by always learning something new. I’m currently learning more about the back-end, specifically GraphQL, express and Apollo. 

<br />

I am currently working with some awesome people at Synapse Studios. We build custom apps used and loved by millions. There, I get to utilize my diverse skillset working on next level products. 🔭 I’m currently working on a mobile workout app for Seniors called Silver Sneakers, built in React Native ✨.

<br />

Fun fact: I have a Golden-Doodle named Bowie⚡️. My hobbies include Golfing, reading, writing, and playing guitar 🎸
