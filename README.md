### Hi, I'm Dillon 👋

👨‍🎨 I craft quality React frontends and have a passion for all things Javascript. 

<br />

🌱 I stay inspired by always learning something new. I currently have a <a href="https://github.com/dillonemorris/mybooks">side project</a> in development where I'm exploring the new <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13">Next 13</a> release. 

<br />

Most recently, collaborating with clients and co-workers to build solid products at <a href="https://formidable.com/">Formidable</a>. 

<br />

Fun fact: I have 2 Golden-Doodles named Bowie⚡️ and Phoebe. My hobbies include basketball, reading, writing, and playing guitar 🎸
